<h1>Understanding the HTML Viewport</h1>

<section>
<h2>1. What is the viewport</h2>
<p>
The viewport is the visible area of a web page inside the browser window.  
Different devices have different viewport sizes.  
A desktop screen is wide, a phone screen is narrow.  
If the page does not adjust to the device, the layout becomes too big or too small.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>2. Why the viewport meta tag is needed</h2>
<p>
Without the viewport meta tag, mobile browsers zoom out automatically.  
The entire page becomes very small, text is hard to read, and the layout does not respond to screen size.  
The viewport meta tag tells the browser to match the page width to the device width and use normal zoom.
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
<b>width=device-width</b> tells the browser to set the page width equal to the device screen width.  
<b>initial-scale=1.0</b> tells the browser to load the page with normal zoom, not zoomed out.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>3. Visual example</h2>
<p>
The image below shows the difference between a page with the viewport tag and a page without it.
</p>

<img src="vp Vs no vp example.png" alt="Viewport example image">
</section>

<h2>4. View the live examples</h2>
<p>
Click the links below to open two versions of the same page.  
Resize your browser window or open on a phone to see the difference.
</p>

<div class="links-container">
    <p><a href="viewport.html" target="_blank">Responsive version with viewport</a></p>
    <p><a href="no-viewport.html" target="_blank">Non responsive version without viewport</a></p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>4.1 Another example with image and text</h2>

<p>
The following example shows how an image and a block of text behave on a responsive page compared to a non responsive page.  
Resize the browser window or open the links on a phone to see the layout change.
</p>

<!-- You will place your image name here -->
<img src="img vp Vs no vp example.png" alt="Responsive image and text example">

<div class="links-container">
    <p><a href="PUT-RESPONSIVE-PAGE-NAME-HERE.html" target="_blank">Responsive version with image and text</a></p>
    <p><a href="PUT-NONRESPONSIVE-PAGE-NAME-HERE.html" target="_blank">Non responsive version with image and text</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Why the image behaves correctly in the responsive page</h3>

<p>
The responsive example uses two important CSS rules:
</p>

<pre><code>
img {
    max-width: 100 percent;
    height: auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
<b>max-width: 100 percent</b> tells the browser that the image should never be wider than its container.  
This allows the image to shrink when the screen is smaller than the image width.  
Without this rule the image keeps its original size and becomes wider than the phone screen.
</p>

<p>
<b>height: auto</b> preserves the correct shape of the image when it is resized.  
The browser adjusts the height automatically so the image does not stretch or get distorted.
</p>

<p>
Together these two rules make the image fully responsive and allow the text to flow below it in a readable layout.

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Viewport defines the visible area of a page</li>
    <li>Mobile browsers zoom out by default if no viewport is set</li>
    <li>The meta viewport tag makes pages responsive</li>
    <li>width=device-width fits the content to the device</li>
    <li>initial-scale=1.0 loads the page at normal zoom</li>
</ul>
